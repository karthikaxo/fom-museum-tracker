# fom-museum-api (❁´◡`❁)

A Python scraper and API for [Fields of Mistria](https://fieldsofmistria.wiki.gg/) that scrapes data from the wiki for all items that can be donated to the in-game museum. This data is provided via a FastAPI backend, with JSON datasets available for reference and/or further use.

## To generate the JSON datasets + img files

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Then, follow this link [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
* Generate each wing in ```POST```.
* Refresh each wing in ```POST``` if required.
* The datasets can be found in ```data/``` in the project root.
```bash
python scrapers/img_scraper.py
```
This creates a folder called ```static/``` that contains the image files. It renames the value of 'img_url' in the JSON
files (which are originally stored as URLs) to the location of these image files.
```bash
python -m app.load_data # to generate the database
```
~ This is what the database looks like (screenshot taken from DB Browser for SQLite)

## Why I made this project ( ´･･)ﾉ(._.`) 
I spent hundreds of hours in this game, and have 100% multiple save files. 
On a recent update of this game, I realized that the trackers I used to note the items I collected 
before were super outdated, so I thought, "Hey, ik a thing or two about coding. Maybe I should make my own." 
And here it is!
